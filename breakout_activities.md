### Breakout group questions

1. Suppose an instructor decides to add 1 data science topic (1 week) to an introductory statistics course for non majors.  What topic should be included and where in the schedule should this topic be taught? 
2. What topics in data science should an undergraduate statistics major be required to learn?
3. What topics should be covered in a “data science for majors”, but not in a “data science for all” course? How much coding is appropriate for “data science for majors” course vs. a “data science for all” course?
4. Over the past few years there has been debate over the difference between data science and statistics.  What are the three most prominent differences in teaching these disciplines?
